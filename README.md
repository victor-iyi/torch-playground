# PyTorch Playground

> This repository is developed for educational purposes using the official
PyTorch tutorials.

**NOTE** Due to issues installing PyTorch with `poetry`, I've commented out the
dependency in `pyproject.toml` and installed it with the following command.
Visit the [PyTorch homepage][pytorch] to check install options with GPU.

```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
